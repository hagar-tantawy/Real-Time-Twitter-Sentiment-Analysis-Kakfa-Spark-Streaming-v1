# Real-Time-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Kakfa-Spark-Streaming 

**Introduction**
The project aims at building a data platform for real time
moderation and analytics of twitter data. The implementation will
utilize different big data technologies as Spark, Kafka and Hive, in
addition to visualization tools for data discovery and delivering
insights.
Objective
1- Use python to stream data from twitter as a source to Kafka
with the right configuration
2- Use Kafka queuing system for twitter messages
3- Use python to create the destination topics with the right
configuration
4- Use Spark structured streaming to fetch and process data
from Kafka.
5- Analyse the tweets sentiment using a simple approach
6- reply with the right message based on the tweetâ€™s sentiment.
7- Output data from spark streaming to HDFS in the form of
parquet files
8- Build a Hive data model (Staging tables + Analytical tables)
that use modelling best practices for big data
9- Use PowerBI to create a dashboard that fetch data from
Hadoop. The trainee is expected to act as an analyst who is
willing to deliver some actionable information to business
users.

**Technologies used:**
1- For streaming data from twitter use
Spark
2- For queuing and persisting messages
Kafka
3- For processing data from Kafka to Hive
Spark Streaming
4- For SQL on Hadoop
Hive
5- For visualization
PowerBI 
6- Scripting 
Python
